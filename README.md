# sorting-everyday
I plan to make a sorting algorithm in python everyday this month.

### 1st of April
A reverse selection sort that sorts an array by finding where it fits using a binary search

### 2nd of April
A weird version of quick sort. Uses the average as the pivot, uses a task system instead of recursion. Weird

### 3rd of April
Almost ran out of time so the simplest sorting algorithm I could think of. I spend time developing a much more intricate algorithm so expect that sometime soon

### 4th of April
Wacky. Puts them into a recursed dictonary. Very Silly

### 5th of April
A quick one today. This feels like it should be called merge sort but I feel like merge sort is very different

### 6th of April
BIG ARRAY. I like this one, its almost like that 'sorting algorithm' in which is async sleeps for the amount of time. The big array isnt needed at all, its just funny

### 7th of April
Today I made a worse version of bogosort. Instead of the whole array shuffing only two items flip. Either way very slow, I had to only include 7 items so it didnt take an eternity to sort

### 8th of April
This one was so close to actually being good however the averages use selection sort to sort themselves. The fact that is has to go through the whole list to sort for the final stages take back any potention use cases. Maybe one day this month I will implement insertion sort and actually make this half useful

### 9th of April
I think this one is actually a valid algorithm. My implementation may be slow but the idea is there. Proud of myself
