# sorting-everyday
I plan to make a sorting algorithm in python everyday this month.

### 1st of April
A reverse selection sort that sorts an array by finding where it fits using a binary search

### 2nd of April
A weird version of quick sort. Uses the average as the pivot, uses a task system instead of recursion. Weird

### 3rd of April
Almost ran out of time so the simplest sorting algorithm I could think of. I spend time developing a much more intricate algorithm so expect that sometime soon

### 4th of April
Wacky. Puts them into a recursed dictonary. Very Silly

### 5th of April
A quick one today. This feels like it should be called merge sort but I feel like merge sort is very different
